Guia de estilos y practicas de codificaci√≥n Python
1.- The PEP8 guidelines for code readability include:
	1.- four spaces for indentation.
	2.- use blank lines to separate functions 	and clases.
 	3.- use spaces around operators and aflter 	commas.

2.- Coding conventions for consistency and manageability include:
	1.- add larger blocks of code inside 	functions. 
	2.- name functions and files using 	lowercase with underscore.
	3.- name calsses using CamelCase.
	4.- name constants in capital letters with 	underscores separating words

3.- Use Static code analysis method to evaluate your code against a predefined style and standard without executing the code.

PRUEBAS UNITARIAS
1.- Unit testing is a method to validate if the units of code are operating as designed.
2.- During code development, each unit is tested. The unit is tested in a continuous integration/continuous delivery test server environment. Once the unit passes the server test, the unit is merged into the final main codebase.
3.- You can use different test functions to build unit tests.
4.- You can review the unit test output and determine if the test passed or failed.

ENVASADO
1.- A Python module is a .py file containing Python definitions, statements functions, and classes.
2.- A package is a collection of python modules into a dictionary with a __init__.py file.
3.- A librery is a collection of packages or it can be a single package.
4.- To create a package:
	1.- Create a folder with the package 	name.
	2.- Create an empty __init__.py file.
	3.- Create the requiered modules.
	4.- In the __init__.py file, add code to
	the modules in the package.
5.- You can verify the package via the bash terminal.
6.- After creating the package, you can use it in other scripts if the package folder is in the same directory.
